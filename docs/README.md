The **ALN_Programming_Language** repository page should be updated to reflect the latest structure, features, and “CircleK Receipt Format” rule, making the project’s game-centric, modular, and AI-native vision clear and actionable for contributors and newcomers alike. Here’s an improved, receipt-style main info and quickstart suitable for copy-pasting into the project’s README or top section:[1]
